        <p class="project-description-description">I am currently designing and building a summer home alongside my
          father, combining our expertise in a hands-on project. While he brings his extensive background in Civil
          Engineering and construction to design the structure, I am responsible for the architectural design and
          interior layout. Our goal is to craft as much of the home by hand as possible, with a focus on creating
          bespoke furniture, lighting, and millwork. I plan to design and build each element personally, ensuring the
          home reflects a true sense of craftsmanship and intentional design. The home draws inspiration from the
          tranquility of a garden and the charm of a treehouse. Upon entering, a brick wall guides you into a private
          garden, creating an intimate sense of seclusion. The kitchen and a covered porch are oriented to embrace the
          serene views of this garden, offering a peaceful retreat. On the opposite side, large windows open to reveal a
          lush canopy of trees, further connecting the interior with nature. Both the exterior and interior are clad in
          natural materials — wood and stone — enhancing the home's organic feel and seamless integration with its
          surroundings.
